# DataVisFinalProject-Visualization of Metagenomic Data 

Note:  

The Process Book and the Feedback from the Peer Review are saved in the cs6630-reports directory

Metagenomic Preprocessing Scripts for Humann3 and Metaphlan are in a separate repository 
https://github.com/leannmlindsey/metagenomicProcessingPipeline

Python and R scripts written specifically for this visualization are in /data/preprocessingScripts

Before we started the process book, we used the wiki on this repository to brainstorm and collect relevant links and other reading material for the group, as well as assignments.

The instructional video link is on the top left corner of the visualization, but it is also here:
