# DataVisFinalProject-Microbiome

I started this repository so that we could share code, data and other relevant information 

I added a list of URLS to the wiki of examples and relevant references 

Please go to the WIkI page and choose 2 visualizations to implement.  Once you select these visualizations, you will be the Responsible Party (RP) for completing those components of the code.  Please ask for help if you get stuck, and everyone can help debug to complete the component, but ultimate you will be responsible for completing that portion of the project.
